# Projects
This is a collection of things I've worked on and want to showcase.

---

## Minecraft Plugins
I focus on developing and maintaining Minecraft server plugins. I've also ran servers off and on since 2011.

You can find my plugins on [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/authors/hyperdefined.599050/), [Hangar](https://hangar.papermc.io/hyperdefined), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/hyperdefined), and my [GitHub](https://github.com/hyperdefined?tab=repositories). Thereâ€™s too many to list here.

## Java Projects
These are standalone projects that use Java, my main coding language.

* [CustomLauncherRewrite](https://github.com/hyperdefined/CustomLauncherRewrite) - A fully standalone custom launcher for Toontown Rewritten.
* [GitHubReleaseAPI](https://github.com/hyperdefined/GitHubReleaseAPI) - A simple and small library for accessing GitHub releases for a repository.
* [CobaltTracker](https://github.com/hyperdefined/CobaltTracker) - Tracker for [cobalt](https://github.com/imputnet/cobalt) instances.

## Websites
I run other websites besides this one.

### Arden Wolfsky's Websites
I manage Arden Wolfsky's websites, who is a dear friend of mine. I run 2 of his websites (and more soon).

* [ardenwolfsky.com](https://ardenwolfsky.com) - Main homepage with socials. Modified version of [LittleLink](https://littlelink.io/).
* [drinks.ardenwolfsky.com](https://drinks.ardenwolfsky.com/) - Drink catalog & recipe information. Built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

### [canine.tools](https://canine.tools)
Collection of open-source web apps in one place, for canines of course. Just a small fun little side project.

### [instances.hyper.lol](https://instances.hyper.lol)
Tracker site for [cobalt](https://github.com/imputnet/cobalt) instances. It has a scoring system to show which ones work better.
