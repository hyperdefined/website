He also has a gray heart on his butt. Likes to wear flower crowns and circle glasses, but arenâ€™t required. Blue eyes & big fang teeth that poke out.

## History

Hyper's first name was originally Dante. He was mostly inspired from Legoshi and my personality. I created him around the end of 2020 for a story I wanted to write. His history and personality were created before his appearance was.

I commissioned him December 2021 for his reference sheet. I wanted his design to be simple, as I didn't want to think to hard on patterns and whatnot.

He's turned into a copy of myself, a way to experiment different aspects of my life onto him.

## Fursuit

My fursuit progress start in the summer of 2022 after I went to Anthrocon. I was super inspired to commission a suit. I ended up getting my fursuit in May of 2023. The original suit was made by [Fur_rain/fil_fur](https://www.instagram.com/fil_fur/). Due to sizing issues, I've replaced some parts with different makers.
