## Home
Awrf! I'm hyperdefined, a fluffy, flower wolf. I'm a furry, therian, and a big disappointment. I’m an IT nerd and developer. I’m also a fursuiter!

I love to code, run servers, play games, read, and listen to music!

I've been coding off and on since 2012, and more seriously since 2018. I've been doing web development even earlier and system admin things since 2018.

This website is my corner of the internet. Please be nice, and wipe your paws before entering!
