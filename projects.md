This is a collection of things I've worked on and want to showcase.

### Minecraft Plugins
I focus on developing and maintaining Minecraft server plugins. I've also ran servers off and on since 2011.

You can find my plugins on [Hangar](https://hangar.papermc.io/hyperdefined), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/hyperdefined), and my [GitHub](https://github.com/hyperdefined?tab=repositories). Thereâ€™s too many to list here.

### Java Projects
These are standalone projects that use Java, my main coding language.

* [CustomLauncherRewrite](https://github.com/hyperdefined/CustomLauncherRewrite) - A fully standalone custom launcher for Toontown Rewritten.
* [GitHubReleaseAPI](https://github.com/hyperdefined/GitHubReleaseAPI) - A simple and small library for accessing GitHub releases for a repository.

### Websites
I run other websites besides this one.

#### Arden Wolfsky's Websites
I manage Arden Wolfsky's websites, who is a dear friend of mine. I run 2 of his websites (and more soon).

* [ardenwolfsky.com](https://ardenwolfsky.com) - Main homepage with socials. Modified version of [LittleLink](https://littlelink.io/).
* [drinks.ardenwolfsky.com](https://drinks.ardenwolfsky.com/) - Drink catalog & recipe information. Built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

#### [canine.tools](https://canine.tools)
Collection of open-source web apps in one place, for canines of course. Just a small fun little side project.
